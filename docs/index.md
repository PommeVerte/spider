# Spider OGM
A simple, flexible, and beautiful graph-data abstraction for php.

Why "Spider?" Because spiders crawl over webs, and webs look like graphs. Walk your data.

## Goals
  * Framework agnostic, generic package using composer.
  * Community-driven, best practices code (DRY, SOLID, PHP The Right Way, PSRs, Tinkerpop, Testing, etc.)
  * An easy transition from SQL or Mongo
  * Simple, fluent, and consistent API
  * An Object-Graph-Mapper and Models inspired by Eloquent, Propel, and Monga.
  * A filter/sendCommand builder that doesn't make your mind go nuts.
  * Simple drivers to connect to specific graph databases (orient, neo4j, titat, etc) or other datastores
  * Handle multiple connections
  * Validation, filtering, security, and performance.
  * Extensible and configurable (e.g. for caching).

## Install
Via Composer

$ composer require spider/spider
