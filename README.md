# Spider Graphs
A simple, flexible, and generic graph-data abstraction for php.

Why "Spider?" Because spiders crawl over webs, and webs look like graphs. Walk your data.

**This is in [proposal](proposal/overview.md) stage right now**, the api is being worked out.
Pull Requests against the proposal documents are welcome from all, not just graph junkies.

Please browse through the [proposal](proposal/overview.md) to see the work in progress. Begin with proposal/overview.md

*Goals*
  * Framework agnostic, generic package using composer.
  * Community-driven, best practices code (DRY, SOLID, PHP The Right Way, PSRs, Tinkerpop, Testing, etc.)
  * An easy transition from SQL or Mongo
  * Simple, fluent, and consistent API
  * An Object-Graph-Mapper and Models inspired by Eloquent, Propel, and Monga.
  * A filter/query builder that doesn't make your mind go nuts.
  * Simple drivers to connect to specific graph databases (orient, neo4j, titat, etc) or other datastores
  * Handle multiple connections
  * Validation, filtering, security, and performance.
  * Extensible and configurable (e.g. for caching).

*Inspired By*
  * [Eloquent ORM](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent)
  * [Hibernate OGM](http://hibernate.org/ogm/)
  * [Propel ORM](http://propelorm.org)
  * [Neo4j Client](https://github.com/neoxygen/neo4j-neoclient)
